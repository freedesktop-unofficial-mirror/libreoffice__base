    /** handles asynchronous links which may be called in multi-threaded environments
        If you use an instance of this class as member of your own class, it will handle
        several crucial points for you (for instance the case that somebody posts the
        event while another thread tries to delete this event in the _destructor_ of the
        class).

            @param		_rHandler			The link to be called asyncronously
            @param		_pEventSafety		A pointer to a mutex to be used for event safety. See below.
            @param		_pDestructionSafety	A pointer to a mutex to be used for destruction safety. See below.

            For a really safe behaviour two mutexes are required. In case your class needs more than one
            OAsyncronousLink instance, you may want to share these mutexes (and hold them as members of
            your class). Thus, if _pEventSafety and _pDestructionSafety are both non-NULL, they will be
            used for the thread-safety of the link. Otherwise the instance will create it's own mutexes.
            <BR>
            If you use this "mutex feature" be aware of the lifetime of all involved objects : the mutexes
            you specify upon construction should live (at least) as long as the OAsyncronousLink object does.
